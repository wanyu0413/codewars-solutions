# Codewars Solutions

[![Codewars Badge](https://www.codewars.com/users/wanyu0413/badges/large)](https://www.codewars.com/users/wanyu0413)

This repository contains my solutions to various [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) katas.  
I use it as a way to track my progress, practice different languages, and experiment with multiple approaches.

## 📂 Structure
- Organized by **language** (Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.)
- Inside each language folder, grouped by **kata difficulty (kyu)**
- File names match kata titles in kebab-case

## 🚀 Goals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Practice clean, readable code
- Document alternative approaches when possible
